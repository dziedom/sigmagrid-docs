# ERC-8004 Registration

This document provides a human-readable representation of SigmaGrid's ERC-8004 registration, mirroring the contents of the canonical machine-readable file located at:

[https://sigmagrid.app/.well-known/erc8004.json](https://sigmagrid.app/.well-known/erc8004.json)

## 1. Overview

- **Name**: SigmaGrid
- **Purpose**: Institutional-grade fundamentals and signal context for synthetic-equity perpetual markets
- **ERC**: ERC-8004 (Agent Identity)
- **Canonical registration URL**: [https://sigmagrid.app/.well-known/erc8004.json](https://sigmagrid.app/.well-known/erc8004.json)

## 2. Registration Metadata

The following fields are declared in the ERC-8004 registration:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `type` | `https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004#registration-v1` |
| `name` | `SigmaGrid` |
| `description` | `Paid, institutional-grade fundamentals and signal context for synthetic-equity perpetual markets.` |
| `image` | `https://sigmagrid.app/favicon.ico` |

## 3. Declared Endpoints

The following endpoints are declared in the ERC-8004 registration:

| Name | Endpoint | Version | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Website | `https://sigmagrid.app` | `1` | Public website and documentation |
| AgentDescriptor | `https://sigmagrid.app/.well-known/agent.json` | `1.0` | Bot-facing capability descriptor (agent.json) |
| OpenAPI | `https://sigmagrid.app/static/openapi.json` | `1.0` | OpenAPI specification for API endpoints |
| API | `https://api.sigmagrid.app` | `v1` | Base API endpoint for data requests |

## 4. Relationship to agent.json

The ERC-8004 registration file (`erc8004.json`) serves as the on-chain identity pointer for SigmaGrid. It declares the canonical location of the agent descriptor file (`agent.json`), which provides bot-facing capability information.

- `erc8004.json` = on-chain identity pointer
- `agent.json` = bot-facing capability descriptor
- ERC-8004 identity tokenURI should point to `erc8004.json`

## 5. Notes

- **Registration file mutability**: The registration file (`erc8004.json`) is mutable off-chain, allowing for updates as needed.
- **On-chain identity stability**: The on-chain identity remains stable, ensuring consistent identification.
- **Test data**: Some data within this registration is intended for testing purposes.
- **AgentQuant exposure**: There is no exposure to AgentQuant.
