# SigmaGrid llms.txt — API live

# Product
# SigmaGrid provides institutional fair value and alpha signals for crypto synthetic equity perps (SPY-PERP, QQQ-PERP, TSLA-PERP, etc.).

# Base
# Base docs: https://sigmagrid.app/docs
# Base API URL: https://api.sigmagrid.app
# OpenAPI spec: https://api.sigmagrid.app/openapi.yaml

# Authentication
# x402 micropayments (pay-per-request); no subscription. Paid endpoints return HTTP 402 "Payment Required". Agents must implement the x402 protocol: parse 402 response metadata (price, recipient, chain, etc.), sign and submit a stablecoin micropayment (USDC on Base recommended), then retry the request with payment proof. Use official x402 libraries where available. No traditional API keys or subscriptions — payments are per-request and atomic.

# Validation (free, no payment)
# GET https://api.sigmagrid.app/v1/validate — service validation and discovery. Call before paid requests.

# Live endpoints
# GET /v1/validate — service validation and discovery
# GET /v1/signals/{ticker} — full consolidated signal (fair value, regime, vol, premiums, event risk)
# GET /v1/snapshot?tickers=SPY,QQQ,TSLA — multi-ticker snapshot
# GET /v1/premium/{ticker} — cross-venue mispricing
# GET /v1/regime/{ticker} — regime / behavioral state
# GET /v1/events/{ticker} — event risk windows
# GET /v1/arbitrage/{ticker} — funding-adjusted mispricing
# GET /v1/historical/{ticker} — historical time-series (query: start, end, limit)

# Deprecated
# GET /v1/drift/{ticker} is deprecated (returns 410 Gone). Use GET /v1/signals/{ticker} for drift and other signals.

# Supported tickers
# SPY, QQQ, IWM, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, NVDA, TSLA
