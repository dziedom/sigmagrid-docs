# SigmaGrid llms.txt — API live

# Product
# SigmaGrid provides institutional fair value and alpha signals for crypto synthetic equity perps (SPY-PERP, QQQ-PERP, TSLA-PERP, etc.).

# Base
# Base docs: https://sigmagrid.app/docs
# Base API URL: https://api.sigmagrid.app
# OpenAPI spec: https://api.sigmagrid.app/openapi.yaml

# Authentication
# x402 micropayments (pay-per-request); no subscription. Paid endpoints return HTTP 402 "Payment Required". Agents must implement the x402 protocol: parse 402 response metadata (price, recipient, chain, etc.), sign and submit a stablecoin micropayment (USDC on Base L2), then retry the request with payment proof. No traditional API keys or subscriptions — payments are per-request and atomic.

# Venues
# Three live venues: Hyperliquid (L1), Avantis (Base via Pyth), Ostium (mainnet, read-only).
# Funding data is Hyperliquid-only (Avantis/Ostium don't support funding).
